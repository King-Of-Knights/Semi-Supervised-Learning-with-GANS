# Semi-Supervised-Learning-with-GANS
General Adversarial Network Stuff

This repo contains code for my course project (cs294 @ UC Berkeley).

It is a re-implementation of techniques seen in this June 2016 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498)

Note that *currently* most of the code is on my aws server. Once everything is working as planned I will post it here, so stay tuned!
